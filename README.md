# Utils

A CLI tool to make some common personal tasks easier. The first problem I want to tackle is that I want to automate some things I have to do manually when editing content for my hugo website.

Eventually I'll explore some other things that could be automated but I thought it would be nice to have all those things nicely bundled in a little CLI tool.

For now, this is primarily a practice project for learning Go.
